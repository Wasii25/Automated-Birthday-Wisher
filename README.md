It's a real pain when you forget the birthday (or any special occasion for that matter). <br>
It's another thing to deal with the emotional baggage that comes along. <br>
Though it doesn't sound good to call this task "mundane" but it can still be automated. <br> <br>
<h1>About the Project</h1><br>
This project uses the smtplib and pandas as the main libraries.<br>
<ol>
  
<li>Pandas reads the birthdays from the csv's which is later checked on the cloud. </li><br>
<li>If it happens to be someone's birthday then rest assured, this bot will send a mail with your special letter that you can type in the letters file.</li> <br>
<li>The bot sends a mail through the smtp connection. </li><br>
<li>The best part is that a few tweaks in the code and you can send them a DM on WhatsApp using twilio too!!!</li>
</ol>
