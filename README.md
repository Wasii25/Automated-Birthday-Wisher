It's a real pain when you forget the birthday (or any special occasion for that matter). <br>
It's another thing to deal with the emotional baggage that comes along. <br>
Though it doesn't sound good to call this task "mundane" but it can still be automated. <br>
This project uses the smtplib and pandas as the main libraries.<br>
Pandas reads the birthdays from the csv's which is later checked on the cloud. <br>
If it happens to be someone's birthday then rest assured, this bot will send a mail with your special letter that you can type in the letters file. <br>
The bot sends a mail through the smtp connection. <br>
The best part is that a few tweaks in the code and you can send them a DM on WhatsApp using twilio too!!!
